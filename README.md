# FakeYou-Streamlabs-TTS

Use Streamlabs text events as TTS.

Change Socket token to your Streamlabs Socket Token API.

You need node-fetch = `npm install node-fetch`

You need socket client = `npm install socket.io-client@2.3.1`
( Chose 2.3.1 Because it's the only socket.io That works with Streamlabs without any issues, Recommended by Streamlabs )
